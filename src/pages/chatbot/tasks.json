(dev: we talked about event driven login function)\n\n= Will the same action plan ever be attended by the same client a second time? Likely not, but it is a possibility\n\n= Is there a standard billable amount of time for any AB or will they each be different? Probably standard, but need to look into further. PAB: in the current context and scope, billable has only meaning as a trigger or disruptive event. e.g. 6030.\n20170831: let's get this answered by Amanda and put in a reference task.\n\n= Flowchart: Has File\nAt this section, even  if AB does not require a doc upload, to give that give that option to client. Or decide to have a general upload in Plan C\n\n= Sidebar: functionality for delayed docs (mail), where they be part of a queue of expected docs.\n\n= RE: the \"not now\" option for client upload. If we do want to ping them as a follow up to ask if they are \"ready to upload now?\" we need to create a new flowchart to cover all the options. Ask Paul\n\n20170831:  simplest approach is at the AB level, to come up with what constitute a complete AB and consider all the parts (request, doc, etc..), e.g. be self contained.  That way the system at large does not have to bother itself with detail about AB.\n\n",

        "notes": "Counselors are making Follow-up Appts in the future.  We need to think how this will affect 60/30 automation AND make sure clients are still getting letters (required of auditing.)  Admin. is suggesting a Too Early date of not less than 60 days before a 2nd appointment is set, and a Too Late date of not more than an appt. 60 days out. \n\nExample  for Too Early:  If client had first appt. with Counselor on March 1, the 2nd appt. couldn't be before May 1 (giving client time to produce Action Item completion.)  Exclusions to this could be:  1) Session 1 does not finish completely - client had to return to work etc. or 2) Mortgage Default counseling type.  These may need action prior to 60 days.  \n\nThen for the Example of Too Late:  That same March 1 counseled appt. could not be given a Follow-up Appt. of July 1 - that is farther out than 60 days.  Remember our HUD rule is client follow-up within 90 days - so always want to stay on the 60 day side of that to allow time to get in touch with client.\n\nReview with staff - then enlist Paul to put some preventions or pop-ups in CMS  \n    Too early: \"This appt. is within 60 days and should not be unless written circumstance is noted\"\n        {if within 60 days of active}\n    Too late: \"Pick an earlier date.  This appt. is not allowed to be set farther out than 75 days\" \n        {if attempt to set date 75 days or later after Active}\n\nR: 4458\n\n",

It should say to \"be patient\", as they will soon be contacted by HANDS, but to first expect an email that contains required documents. We can also update the current confirmation ticket screen to say \"be patient\"/\"look for email\"\n- No need for the email to link back to the confirmation ticket screen, though we could link to the survey so as to not miss that opportunity. \n- Both in ES and EN\n \n- Amanda was informed of the date delay issue\n\nScope: \n- Upon email validation, send an email confirmation to client with all details found on confirmation ticket screen.\n- Content changes confirmation ticket screen (be patient) and confirmation email (be patient\"/\"look for email)\n- Multilingual\nEstimation: 2.5 hrs \n\nR:3903, \nDB Updates: ch_letters\n\nUpdate Log (19 Dec 2018):\n RE: https://app.asana.com/0/23510325566565/944599455304598",
